# Global Population Trends - Project Output

This repository contains the final deliverables of a comprehensive data visualization project. The files here represent the polished output and embedded dashboard from a multi-stage project workflow.

## Key Deliverables

* `global-population-trends.html`: The final web page containing the embedded Tableau dashboard and story, integrated with a Flask UI. This file is the primary output of the project's web integration phase.
* `world-population-data.csv`: The final, processed dataset used for the visualizations.

## Project Workflow

The complete project followed a structured methodology to deliver the final output:

* **Problem Understanding:** Defined the business problem, requirements, and social/business impact of analyzing population trends.
* **Data Collection & Database Operations:** Collected the dataset, stored it in a database, performed SQL operations, and connected it to Tableau.
* **Data Visualization:** Created multiple unique visualizations, a responsive dashboard, and a multi-scene story in Tableau.
* **Web Integration:** Embedded the final Tableau dashboard and story into a web UI using Flask.
* **Documentation:** Created project documentation and a video demonstrating the end-to-end solution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools Used

* **Database:** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) - For storing and performing SQL operations on the data.
* **Tableau:** The primary tool used for creating all visualizations, dashboards, and stories.
* **Flask:** The web framework used to build the UI and embed the Tableau content.
* **HTML:** For the final web page integration.
* **SQL:** For data extraction and preparation.
* **CSV:** For the final dataset.
